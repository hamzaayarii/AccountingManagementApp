📊 Accounting Management System
 

A modern, AI-powered web application designed to streamline financial processes for Tunisian businesses. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this platform automates accounting tasks, ensures real-time tax compliance, and provides predictive analytics tailored to the Tunisian market. Developed by the ChillGuys team at ESPRIT, Tunisia.

🚀 Project Overview
The Accounting Management System simplifies accounting for Tunisian accountants, financial managers, and business owners. It addresses the challenges of manual data entry, regulatory compliance, and costly software by offering an affordable, user-friendly, and AI-driven solution.
🌟 Key Features

Automated Bookkeeping: Reduces manual errors and saves time.
Real-Time Tax Compliance: Aligns with Tunisian regulations.
Financial Reporting: Generates accurate statements and interactive dashboards.
AI-Powered Insights: Predictive analytics and smart task prioritization.
User-Friendly Design: Accessible for small businesses and professionals.
Scalable & Secure: Supports multiple users with JWT authentication and encryption.

🎯 Why This Project?
Current solutions like SAGE, Odoo, Swiver, and Wave often lack AI automation, are expensive, or aren’t tailored to Tunisian laws. Our platform:

Offers affordable pricing for small businesses.
Integrates AI for forecasting and automation.
Ensures compliance with Tunisian tax regulations.
Provides an intuitive interface for all users.
