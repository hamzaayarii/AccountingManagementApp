Accounting Management System

Overview

The Accounting Management System is a modern, AI-powered web application designed to simplify and automate financial processes for Tunisian businesses. Tailored to comply with Tunisian accounting and tax regulations, this platform leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to deliver a scalable, user-friendly, and innovative solution for accountants, financial managers, and business owners.

This project was developed as part of the Web Development Integrated Project by the ChillGuys team from ESPRIT, Tunisia.

An intuitive interface suitable for businesses of all sizes.
